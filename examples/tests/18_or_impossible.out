The formula
 □[0s,∞) (∀x:int. ∀y:int. C(y:int) ∨ A(x:int) → B(y:int) ∧ B(x:int))
is not enforceable. To make it enforceable, you would need to
 make □[0s,∞) (∀x:int. ∀y:int. A(x:int) ∨ C(y:int) → B(x:int) ∧ B(y:int)) <NonObs,Cau,ErrSct>, but this is impossible (for causability x:int must be past-guarded)
